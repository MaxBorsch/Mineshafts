# This is for my GCI Task (I) - Structure Templates.

I have created Two new and awsome Structures!

The Following are my  Newly Created Structures :

1) A Stage

(a) With four Pillars and Added Torches.

(b) With Boundary 

(c) With left one Block Regions for Entrance of other Players/Characters.

2) A Waterpool

If Terasology would use my structures then the stage would be used for Dance performances , Competitions ,
performing Rituals and even for fighting!
Waterpool will be used from simple bath to Holy Bath!
